The csv files included in this data folder are simulated example data. 
Files with these names and formats are required to run main.py, which will run 
the specified model and generate results.


The model parameters are defined in *mode.csv* and should have these variables, 
with only 1 row to specify a model: 

- "_model"	: string model name label

- "mode_selection"	: numeric value 1, 2, or 3 to set the Model Mode

- "budget" : total annual agency budget, supply numeric value with no characters, 
             e.g. 200000 for a $200,000 budget.
             
- "stat_year"	: target year for the model, used for labeling purposes

- "annual_growth_rate" : numeric value between 0 and 1. Defines the rate of spread of CWD



The sub-administrative level information is captured in *SAM_input.csv*. 
This file should have one row for each geographic area to be included in the model.
The file should include variables:

- "_id" :  a unique identifier that identifies the geographic unit, e.g. name, FIPS code, or other ID.

- "include"	: TRUE or FALSE depending on whether to include that area in the model. 
              Those with include == FALSE will not be included in the model.
              
- "MaxSample"	: The number of maximum samples that can be taken, e.g. sampling capacity, 
                in that geographic area. Should be integer value.
                
- "Historical sampling - year1"	: Historical number of samples that were taken in 
                                  the geographic area 1 year before the target year, 
                                  i.e. the most recent year of sampling. Should be integer value.
                                  
- "Historical sampling - year2"	: Historical number of samples that were taken in
                                  the geographic area 2 years before the target year. 
                                  Should be integer value.
                                  
- "Historical sampling - year3"	: Historical number of samples that were taken in
                                  the geographic area 3 years before the target year.
                                  Should be integer value.
                                  
- "introduction_rate" : The introduction rate is the estimate rate of CWD introduction 
                        into that area. Values should be greater than 0. If an 
                        area has a risk of 0 it should be excluded from the model.
                        
- "unit_cost" : the cost to administer one CWD test (adding all costs such as 
                personnel, test costs, procurement, etc.) in that geographic area; 
                could be average cost or estimated.
